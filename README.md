Summary of Technical Decisions:

1. Grid-Based Movement: The game utilizes a grid-based movement system where the player-controlled hero moves within a 16x16 grid.
2. Components and GameObjects:
- GameManager: Manages game state, including spawning and rotating heroes, handling collisions, and managing game over conditions.
- PlayerController: Handles player input and movement, rotates the hero line, and interacts with the GameManager.
- CollisionHandler: Detects collisions between the player and obstacles, collectible heroes, and monsters, triggering appropriate actions.
- GameOverScreen: Manages the game over screen UI and restart functionality.
3. Prefab Usage: Prefabs are used for heroes, obstacles, monsters, and the game over screen to ensure consistency and ease of instantiation.
4. Unity's Physics System: Colliders are attached to GameObjects representing heroes, monsters, and obstacles to detect collisions. Trigger colliders are optionally used for non-physical interactions.
5. Unity Tilemap: A Tilemap component is used for creating and rendering the grid-based game board, providing a visually appealing grid environment.
  
With these technical decisions, the game is structured to provide a grid-based Snake-like experience with RPG elements,
where the player controls a growing line of heroes to fight monsters and overcome obstacles.
